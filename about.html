        <h2>A bit of background</h2>
          <p>Jumping into my UX/UI Design career has been a long time coming for me.
          Since I graduated college, I went into years of sales and, while I've always enjoyed
          working with people, the more exciting aspect of my leasing agent position
          was designing the business & resident discount cards. Just like when I was
          in college designing posters & clothing as publicity chair for my acapella group,
          I would design for hours without noticing how much time has passed.

          <br><br>
          Outside of design, I had not yet experienced the phenomenon of being so
          focused and passionate about my work that I forgot the clock. I had considered
          working in design before but, as I didn't know any HTML or CSS, I was intimidated
          to start. When I decided to finally go for it and start taking Bloc's web design course,
          I was still concerned. However, after creating my first projects, I am so
          excited that I took this leap.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h2>My design philosophy</h2>
          <p>Based on my past in customer service as a leasing agent and IT recruiter,
          along with my Bachelor's degree in psychology & sociology, I have the ability to put
          myself in the mind of our users. I tend to attack design problems with
          full focus on the user to understand what they would want and need from
          my designs.
          <br><br>

          I enjoy the design process, tweaking and changing things until both
          myself and the client are satisfied with the result. Being comfortable with
          HTML, CSS, and Javascript allows for seamless communication with the
          development team so that designer, developer, and client are all on the
          same page.
          <br><br>

          I love that design is a life long learning process, and I am excited to finally start
          a career in design that I am both proud of and passionate about. To me, web design used to be intimidating-- Something completely out
          of reach for me. However, after creating my first projects, I am so
          excited that I took this leap. I am actually happy, enjoying what I'm doing for
          the first time.</p>
