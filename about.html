        <h2>A bit of background</h2>
          <p>Jumping into my UX/UI Design career has
            been a long time coming for me. Since
            graduation from college, I worked in
            sales positions as a leasing agent and IT
            recruiter. Although I enjoyed the challenge
            of sales and working with people, the most
            exciting aspect was designing business and
            resident discount cards. Just as when I was
            in college designing posters and clothing as
            publicity chair for my acapella group, I would
            design for hours without noticing how much
            time has passed.
          <br><br>
            Outside of design, I had not yet experienced the
            phenomenon of being so focused and passionate
            about a project that it no longer felt like work.
            I had previously considered a career in design
            before but was intimidated to start without any
            prior HTML or CSS knowledge. When I finally
            decided to change careers and take Bloc’s web
            design course, I was still concerned because
            change involves risk. After creating my first
            projects, however, I am glad I took this leap
            and am confident that I made the right decision.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h2>My design philosophy</h2>
          <p>Because of my experience in customer service
            as a leasing agent and IT recruiter, along with
            my Bachelor's degree in Psychology and Sociology,
            I have the ability to put myself in the mind of
            our users. I tend to attack design problems with
            full focus on the user to understand what they
            want and need from my designs, even if our users
            don’t know how to articulate it.
          <br><br>

          I enjoy the design process, especially tweaking and
          changing elements until my client is pleased. Being
          comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript allows
          for seamless communication with the development team
          so that designer, developer, and client are all on
          the same page.
          <br><br>

          Design is a life long learning process, and I am
          excited to finally embark on a career that I am
          both proud of and passionate about. To me, web
          design used to be intimidating-- something
          completely unattainable. However, after creating
          my first projects, I am pleased to be prepared
          for a career in a field that is a match for my
          interests and talents.</p>
