        <h2>A bit of background</h2>
          <p>I knew that product design was the career for me
            starting when I was in college. I would design posters,
            clothing, and tickets for my acapella group and work for
            so long that I wouldn't notice how much time had past. Even
            after graduating, I worked in sales and recruitment and the
            most exciting part of each of those roles was designing merchandise
            and emails. Eventually, I decided to jump in and take an intensive
            bootcamp course with Bloc, and I haven't looked back.
          <br><br>
          <h2>My design philosophy</h2>
          <p>Because of my experience in customer service
            as a leasing agent and IT recruiter, along with
            my Bachelor's degree in Psychology and Sociology,
            I have the ability to put myself in the mind of
            our users. <span class="bio-emphasis">I attack design problems with
            full focus on the user to understand what they
            want and need from my designs.</span>
          <br><br>

          I enjoy the design process, especially iterating and
          changing elements until my client is pleased. Being
          comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript allows
          for seamless communication with the development team
          so that designer, developer, and client are all on
          the same page.
          <br><br>
          Since my first design project years ago, I knew that Product Design was
          the right path. Not only do I appreciate and enjoy the work, but I
          have a keen eye for what the users will be thinking and am
          able to accommodate for a seamless user experience. I have experience
          working individually on a project as well as in a team. While I can
          perform all aspects of the design process alone, it is helpful to work
          with a group of like-minded designers who all bring something to the
          table. Design is a life-long learning process, and I look forward to
          continuing to grow as a designer.</p>
