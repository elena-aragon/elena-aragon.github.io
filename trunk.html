          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>Many cloud storage apps available today do not address all of their
            users needs which forces users to utilize multiple apps. We wanted to
            solve this and create an app that will allow users to use just our app
            instead of using several different ones for different purposes. I
            managed this project from start to finish, beginning with just a concept
            and ending with a finished prototype.
            Along the way, I performed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ES3-Zd_myX4wv9js-yfzjEVoxPW9UtVEF7vv0DktIRU/edit?usp=sharing">research,</a> created
            <a href="https://invis.io/QHNNTWKEVY9">wireframes</a> and <a href="https://invis.io/F6NZ726JUQE">mockups,</a> with Figma & Sketch,
            decided on all <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/0kjONsbqKhfT068tWNtNCYeC/Trunk-Style-Guide?node-id=0%3A1">branding and design,</a> and completed the
            project by creating a prototype using Invision.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Our task was to create a cloud
          storage app that would be a major
          competitor to apps like Google
          Drive, Pinterest, etc.  The primary
          features were to save web content,
          organize & create content, upload
          files, and allow users to
          collaborate. Our goal was to
          combine these features and more
          to create a compelling and user
          friendly cloud storage app.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="solution">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Our solution was to create a simple,
          user friendly cloud storage app
          called Trunk that allows users to
          use our platform for all of their
          needs. Our research indicated two
          major findings. Our first finding
          was that we needed a
          collaboration feature. Our second
          finding was that the main concern
          with cloud storage is security.
          Using this information, we designed
          an attractive and useful app that
          will become a main competitor for
          the cloud storage apps available.</p>
          </section>
        </div>




      <section class="process">
        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>Trunk was developed out of desire to create
          a cloud storage app that would combine the popular features of other apps into
          a simple but highly useful one that would serve all of our users cloud storage
          needs. We started with just an idea and built Trunk with
          the following steps.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="research">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Before starting our design, we wanted to ensure that we were designing what
          the users want.  In order to find which features are most useful, we created a
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ES3-Zd_myX4wv9js-yfzjEVoxPW9UtVEF7vv0DktIRU/edit?usp=sharing">
          cloud storage survey</a> that asked whether respondants used cloud storage, why
          or why not, which features they preferred, and more. <br><br>

          Our findings were that the highest priority features were accessing files from
          anywhere, sharing content, and backing up data.  For those who do not use
          cloud storage, the were primarily concerned about privacy and security.
        </p>

      </section>
      <section class="competitive-analysis">
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>After our survey data was complete, we went on to perform
          a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TN1hiMt_ZiAhOkT6tuNnsMsSy6lKLEhSg-o9ADi5DOU/edit?usp=sharing">competitive analysis</a>
          of other current cloud storage apps for
          their strengths and flaws. We conducted a  analysis of
          two different cloud storage apps-- Google Drive and Dropbox.
          <br><br>
          We found their strengths to include having nothing to
          download, easy sharing, auto saving, and a free option. We
          found weaknesses to be primarily a lack of ability to save web
          content. We took these results into account when deciding on
          our app structure.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="user-personas">
        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <p>We wanted to get into the minds of our users to make sure we were designing
          Trunk with them in mind, so we created <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13HizIb0E-ieXPNEtloUujx59UQsrvFuP/view?usp=sharing">user personas.</a> Our two user personas
          were Laura, the busy woman who likes to keep her content organized,
          and Aaron, the student who needs to have the ability to back up, share, and
          collaborate on his files.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="user-stories-and-flows">
        <h2>User Stories & Flows</h2>
        <p>We then created <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUT-_uCNvhTzuhUhzZLP28iCrt60ugMepHrKtxRfEPs/edit?usp=sharing">user stories</a>
          to determine which actions our users want to use
          every time they log in, only occasionally, and rarely to be sure to properly
          prioritize the former. The most important features are to be able to create an
          account, login, upload files, access files from anywhere, collaborate, answer
          security questions to verify identity, and auto backups. <br><br>

          These user stories were then converted into <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-gCh6H-ABQqQHfucbMEoJIjen3StJAXi?usp=sharing">user flows</a>
          to map each process from point A to point B.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="wireframes-and-usability-tests">
        <h2>Wireframes & Usability Tests</h2>
        <p>Now, after weâ€™d done our research, we were ready to begin designing. We used
          our user flows to create wireframes for each of our high priority user stories and
          created a <a href="https://invis.io/QHNNTWKEVY9">clickable prototype</a> in which our users could go through and act out
          all of the high priority actions.
          <br><br>
          We wanted to test this prototype to make sure that our proceses were user
          friendly, so we conducted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ujYUyWcAnEDiBf6AnRC1Pn0Aj6WOoe9O0CvXpOB-wFU/edit?usp=sharing">usability tests</a> asking our participants to create an
          account, upload a document, and organize a piece of content.
          <br><br>
          What we learned from this was that our sign up process was a bit too long. We
          took this finding and incorporated it into our design as well as the other
          feedback we received.  You can see our original sign up process as well as our
          updated sign up process below.

      <section class="branding">
        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>We moved forward to create mockups of our designs. First, we needed to
          decide on solid branding for our app which first needed to include a name
          and a logo. The name Trunk works in two ways: Elephants of course have a reputation
          for having a long memory and a trunk is where people store things. Storage and
          memory together are exactly what weâ€™re creating. We then focused on our logo,
          which had many different iterations but eventually became the silhouette of an
          elephant with the trunk creating the letter U in Trunk. My original sketches and
          finished logo are below.
        </p>
        <img src="images/mobile-trunk-sketches.png" alt="original trunk sketches" class="sketches">
        <img src="images/trunk-logo-bw.png" alt="black & white trunk logo" class="bw-trunk-logo">
        <p>With our logo in place, we moved on to create a color scheme, typography,
          buttons, and much more. We created a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/0kjONsbqKhfT068tWNtNCYeC/Trunk-Style-Guide?node-id=0%3A1">comprehensive style guide </a>
          to organize all of these thoughts. Using this branding, we moved forward to design our
          mockups.
        </p>
        <div class="trunk-logos">
          <img src="images/white-trunk-logo.png" alt="white trunk logo" class "white-trunk-logos">

        </div>

        <img src="images/mobile-trunk-style-guide.png" alt="trunk buttons, color palette, and typography" class="trunk-style-guide">
      </section>

      <section class="mockups">
        <h2>Mockups</h2>
        <p>Keeping in mind our style guide and branding decisions, we went forward to
          design 121 individual mockup screens that would become our prototype. These
          were more colorful and attractive than our wireframes. After many drafts and
          changes, we moved forward to creating our second clickable prototype. <br><br>

          When we were finished, we conducted another <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uM7YAzgGMSITabNSVgLuI5BGBBD2EI2nCQF2fm_Fj6Y/edit">usability test</a> to ensure that our
          design was user friendly and we found this time that half of the users wanted to
          take the original route to adding content to a folder, so we changed the process
          to include both possible routes to make it easier for our users. After many drafts
          and multiple tests, our <a href="https://invis.io/F6NZ726JUQE">final prototype</a> was ready.
        </p>

      <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Throughout this project, I learned that the first steps in creating the skeleton
          of a project are the most critical ones, as without a solid foundation, the project
          crumbles. Everything needs to be thought out in detail and the designs need to
          be very consistent throughout to make a user friendly experience. <br><br>

          Originally, we were doubtful that there was need for such a product or that
          weâ€™d be able to create a worthy competitor for the current cloud apps out there.
          However, after all of our hard work, we were pleasantly surprised to find that
          we did find the right combination of features and feel confident in Trunkâ€™s
          potential.
