        <p>I grew up thinking that a career is not supposed to be fun, and was
          prepared for such a lifestyle. However, in college I discovered one
          area that did not feel like work-- Designing as Publicity Chair for
          my acapella group.
          <br><br>

          I would sit down and space out for hours, forgetting to eat,
          meticulously changing things until it was perfect. I was spending
          hours out of my day designing (when I probably should have been
          studying… ) and would finish feeling proud and exhillterated.
          <br><br>

          However, after I graduated and went into years of sales, I realized
          there was something missing. Never once was I so passionate about what
           I was doing that I forgot the clock.
          <br><br>

          I had considered working in design before, but looking at professional
          ads, I was convinced that those designers must have prodigious skill
          that I didn’t have.
          <br><br>

          Then, when I was working as an IT recruiter, I interviewed a web
          designer named Carla and was blown away by her portfolio. We talked
          more casually about her earlier work, and she thought it would make
          me laugh to see her first projects. She was right. They were pretty
          terrible, with frightening color scemes (seriously, one was teal,
          brick red, and mud brown), horrifying spacing, and comically cliche
          logos.
          <br><br>

          I came to the realization that would change my life: People in design
          are not off the charts creative prodigies. They are totally normal
          people who took the time to learn design and can now create incredible
          work. They worked at it and practiced to become the designers they are
          today. So… What am I waiting for?
          <br><br>

          To me, web design used to be intimidating-- Something completely out
          of reach for me. However, after creating my first projects, I am so
          excited that I took this leap.
          <br><br>

          For one thing, my initial designs were not horrifying-- They were
          actually pretty good. It’s fun for me to anticipate a user’s needs and
          figure out the most creative & attractive solutions possible. For
          another, I’ve lost a bit of weight being so focused that I forget to
          eat. And finally, I am actually happy. I enjoy what I’m doing for the
          first time and I’m proud of myself for making a change.
