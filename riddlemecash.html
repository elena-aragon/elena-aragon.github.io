          <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
          <p>RiddleMeCash is a game, currently available in android and iOS
            app stores, that allows the user to put their money where their
            mouth is. The game generates a daily riddle and the user can bet
            on their ability to solve the riddle successfully using coins
            purchased in the app store. The user can also purchase bonuses
            like extra time or a hint to improve their changes at getting the
            riddle correct. Then, the daily rankings are released and the user
            can brag to their friends and family knowing that they are the best
            riddle-solver in the group.
            <br><br>


            I worked with the client very closely on this project, helping them
            to not only create the UX and UI but also to help flesh out the idea
            in general. During my time with RiddleMeCash, I created Wireframes
            and Mockups for both Android and iOS devices as my final deliverable,
            working with the overseas development team to ensure they were
            implemented correctly. I started by conducting a <a href="#competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</a>
            of similar games, creating <a href="#user-stories-and-flows">User Stories & Flows</a>,
            <a href="#wireframes-and-usability-tests"> Wireframes,</a>
            skipping User Surveys and User Personas at the client's request. Then,
            I proceeded to create the <a href="#branding">Branding + Logo Design</a> and
            <a href="#mockups">High Fidelity Mockups</a> for both iOS and Android devices.
            Throughout the process, I used Figma and Sketch to bring the project to life.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Our task was to create a game that allows users to bet on their ability
          to solve a complex riddle correctly, purchase coins to keep playing,
          and display a leaderboard to show user rankings. While there are similar
          games available today, none combine the human instinct for competition, cash
          rewards, and mind-scrambling riddles all into one. The goal was to
          create a simple, fun, user friendly app with our users in mind. </p>
      </section>


      <section class="solution">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Our solution was RiddleMeCash-- A clean yet approachable and
          completely original app game that allows our users to put their
          money where their mouth is and bet to win both money and bragging
          rights with their friends and family. Our competitive analysis
          indicated that most gaming apps have a whimsical and colorful
          appearance as well as some unfortunate user experience problems.
          We decided to create a colorful yet professional interface that is
          more user friendly than our competitors. </p>

      <section class="process">
          <h1 class="primary-headers">PROCESS</h1>
          <p> We created RiddleMeCash with the idea that our users would spend money
            to earn coins that would allow them to play a riddle and increase their
            earnings if they are correct while competing with friends and family.
            We started with this simple idea and then followed the following process.

        <h1 class="secondary-headers">1. DISCOVERY & RESEARCH</h1>

      </section>
      <section class="competitive-analysis">
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>We started the process of creating RiddleMeCash by conducting a
          Competitive Analysis of other games on the market. We conducted a
          SWOT analysis of two different apps: Just Riddles and Brain Teasers.
          <br><br>
          Just Riddles’ strengths included a <span style="font-weight:600">higher app store rating and a high
          number of customers.</span> However, their weaknesses included <span style="font-weight:600"> quite a bit of
          heavy/bold text that makes the screen feel cluttered as well as a confusing
          user experience.</span> In addition, <span style="font-weight:600">they did not have any way of enticing their
          users to pay</span> for additional features and rely heavily on inconvenient advertisements. <br><br>

          Brain Teasers’ strengths included <span style="font-weight:600">a colorful and fun color scheme and
          high number of riddles as well as a clear method of increasing your score.</span> Their weaknesses
          included that <span style="font-weight:600">it is a very simple game that is easy to get bored with,
          plus whimsical and childish UI.</span> In addition, <span style="font-weight:600">they too did
          not have a way to earn money lacked any competitive aspect.</span><br><br>

          After reviewing this research with the client, we decided that our app
          UI needed to be more professional than its competitors while still maintaining
          an element of whimsy. We wanted to include competitiveness as a motivator and
          allow the user to continue playing if they purchase additional time. Many of
          our competitors have perfectly adequate apps, but we want to create something
          that is more enticing, more interesting, and overall more fun for the user.

        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>After presenting the wireframes to my client, I proceeded to work on the
          Branding for RiddleMeCash. The client had already decided on the name for
          RiddleMeCash, so I began working on a logo. After presenting some sketches to the client, we decided on the logos below.
        </p>
      <div class="riddlemecash-logos">
        <!-- <img src="images/evalueat-sketches.png" alt="original trunk sketches" class="sketches"> -->

        <img src="images/riddlemecash-logos.png" alt="riddlemecash logos" class="riddlemecash-logo">

        <img src="images/white-evalueat-logo.png" alt="white evalueat logo" class="white-trunk-logos">

        <!-- <img src="images/black-evalueat-logo.png" alt="black evalueat logo" class="black-trunk-logos"> -->
      </div>

      <p>Alongside the logo, we also needed to decide on a color scheme. We knew that we wanted something
        that was still fun but more professional and classy than some of those we had seen from our
        competitors. After some deliberation, we chose the color scheme below.</p>

      <section class="conclusion">
        <h1 class="secondary-headers">4. CONCLUSION<h1>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>This was the first project I worked on in which I was collaborating directly with the client.
          The most interesting thing that I learned throughout this experience was that the client
          does not always know what they want and it is my job to guide them to a solution if
          necessary. I also learned the necessity of consulting with the client frequently
          to ensure that their vision, as well as my own, are being carried out in tandem.
          I can say that I am proud of this project and think that RiddleMeCash fills a gap
          in the market that was otherwise untouched.
