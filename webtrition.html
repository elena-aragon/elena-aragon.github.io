  <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
  <p>Planning menus can be incredibly complex when working with multiple
    locations, meal periods, nutrition standards,
    and hundreds of individual menu items. Compass
    Group created a website to easily be able to <span style="font-weight:600">
    track, edit, and analyze </span> this
    information.
    <!-- data. I helped to decide on the features and interactions in the
    website, created mockups within a set style guide, presented several options
    to the business and functional team, and worked
    with the development team to ensure implementation.  -->
    Since Webtrition is such a data heavy application, we had to try to make the
    interface as clean as possible. <span style="font-weight:600">
    I worked on this project as a UX/UI Designer on a two person team from March
    2019 - Present. </span>

    <br><br>

    The process at Compass Group was a combination of Agile and Waterfall which
    was unusual. The process started with a whiteboarding session. The client would not permit us to conduct user testing, user
    flows, or user surveys, so our designs were based solely off of the use cases
    and feedback provided by the business. From there, we had to skip
    low-fidelity wireframing and go directly to mockups of several options that fit the use
    cases provided.

    Due to this rather unusual process,
    I was not able to conduct the steps that I would typically take to take a
    project from start to finish. That being said, working with the team in such
    an unorthodox way allowed me to learn about the value of a clear and defined
    design process to maximize efficiency and usability. While I worked on
    dozens of sub-projects within Webtrition, below are several examples of
    the designs that I was responsible for including the <a href="#pending-manager">Pending Manager
  </a>, <a href="#forecasting">Forecasting Overrides</a>, and <a href="#analysis">Cost Analysis</a>.

<div class="problem-solution">
<section class="problem">
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Our task was to simplify a data heavy website that would allow users to
  easily create, edit, and manage multiple types of menus for multiple
  locations. The goal was to be able to display the vast amount of information
  that the user needs to see in a clear and visually appealing way.  </p>
</section>


<section class="solution">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Our solution was to create a web application called Webtrition that allows
  users to utilize our platform for all of their menu and dietary planning needs.
  I was a member of a two person design team that worked with the business team,
  functional team, development team, and QA team to ensure that the product
  works for all intended use cases, is more simple to use than the original
  version, and fufils the business’ needs. </p>

<section class="process">
    <h1 class="primary-headers">PROJECTS</h1>
    <p> Webtrition is, very simply, used to create and modify menus. The user
      needs to be able to create these menus for multiple locations, nutrient
      standards, diets, and meal counts. In order to do this, they need to see
      all of this information for each meal period for every individual day of
      the menu. This is a tremendous amount of information as they can have
      multiple locations with up to 90 diets each which results in hundreds
      of menu items for each meal period. With the users' needs in mind, we
      built the following pieces of Webtrition using a combination Waterfall and
      Agile process.

<section id="pending-manager">
  <section class="pending-summary">
    <h1 class="secondary-headers">1. PENDING MANAGER</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Sometimes when a user makes a change to their main diet, it is unclear whether they want the change to apply across the
      entire menu or only for that particular diet. In this situation, the affected items are referred to as “Pending.” We needed
      to create a way for the user to see all of their Pending items
      together, confirm or deny the change, and save it so that there were no
      longer any unclear items.
    </p>

    </section>

    <section class="pending-whiteboarding">
      <h2>Whiteboarding & Conceptualization</h2>
      <p>We wanted a way for the user to see all of their Pending items and make
        changes accordingly. Instead of crowd the screen or create a modal for
        the Pending items, we decided to create a separate Pending Manager. These were a
        few of our general designs for the Pending Manager. These whiteboarding
        images are from my contribution to our whiteboarding session.

    <section class="pending-mockups">
      <h2>Mockups</h2>
      <p>The business was opposed to allowing our team to conduct usability tests,
        user surveys, or user flows, so after whiteboarding we moved on to creating
        mockups. Working within the set  style guide, I created this interface to allow the user to see the
        individual week & day where the pending item took place, see the diet and
        menu item that is problematic, and make bulk changes directly from this screen.
        <!-- screen. These were a few of the screens I created for this interaction. -->

        <p>I built out this interaction after presenting the first mockups to
          the business. The prototype allows the team to see how the

          correctly in development. You can see the prototype

    <h1 class="secondary-headers">2. FORECASTING</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>When creating a menu, the user needs to estimate how much of each menu
      item to make. In doing this, they need to find the balance between
      running out of that menu item and having too much left over. If their estimate is wrong,
      they need to override the numbers they’ve set to make the data
      more accurate. To allow for these updates, we created a screen to
      override this data.

    <section class="forecasting-mockups">
      <h2>Mockups</h2>
      <p>For this interaction, the user needs to select a date in order to see
        the current data for that menu and make changes. We went through several
        iterations of this date selection design after running into both business
        dissent and developmental road blocks.

        All of the original interactions were all intended to end on this screen
        that allows the user to change the Total Census and all of the individual
        “Total Meals” for each menu item. Please see the different design iterations
        created below due to changes in use case and developmental road blocks.

      <h1 class="secondary-headers">3. COST ANALYSIS</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>The user also needs to keep track of the budget when planning menus. The user needs to set
        a target price for average cost per meal, see which days and weeks are
        above the target price, and navigate elsewhere to make the necessary
        changes. Once again, this is an incredible about of data to display as
        the user has multiple locations, diets, and up to 16 weeks to view. To
        show this data efficiently, we created a screen to display the Cost
        Analysis summary. This was a re-design of an existing screen that was
        both inefficient and did not contain all of the necessary data. I was
        acting as lead designer on this project and was able to insist on
        low fidelity wireframes before creating mockups.

<section class="conclusion">
<h1 class="secondary-headers">4. CONCLUSION<h1>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>This project was quite different than the work I had previously done for several reasons.
  Firstly, I had not experienced a business who insisted that we skip aspects of the design process
  like usability testing and low fidelity mockups. Secondly, I had not worked within a set style
  guide to maintain consistency as I was always starting a project from the beginning and not
  joining in the middle as I was for Webtrition. At the outset, we were concerned about being able
  to display so much data at the business’ request without overwhelming the user, but by designing
  with usability in mind we were able to create something that is both informational and simple at the same time.
