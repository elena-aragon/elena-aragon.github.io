          <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
          <p>While there are many apps available that can help you to find reviews
            for a restaurant, at this point there is no viable way to see reviews
            for individual menu items helping the customer in deciding what to order.
            We wanted to solve this problem and create an app that would allow
            restaurant patrons to view specific ratings and reviews for each item on a
            restaurant’s menu effectively assisting them in knowing what to order.
            <br><br>

            I came up with this business idea and managed the project starting from
            brainstorming the idea and ending with prototypes for both mobile and
            desktop.  For the UX portion of the project, I conducted <a href="#competitive-analysis">Competitive

            <a href="https://invis.io/DCQ9YPOK6XH" target="_blank">Mobile</a>.  Throughout the process, I used Figma, Sketch,
            Invision, and Maze to make my project come to life.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Our task was to create an app that would allow restaurant patrons to
           see reviews not only for a restaurant but also for each individual
           dish that the restaurant serves.  We wanted to allow customers to view
           dish reviews, search for dishes by restaurant or menu item, write
           reviews on their culinary experiences. The goal was to create a simple,
           attractive, and user friendly app. </p>
      </section>


      <section class="solution">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Our solution was EvaluEat-- A simple, user friendly, and original dish
          review app that will allow our users to see a restaurant’s menu and see
          their Top Dishes as well as reviews for each dish the restaurant offers.
          Our User Survey indicated that our users wanted to easily see top rated
          dishes, search for menu items, and write a review with a rating, detailed
          review, and optional photo. Using this information, we designed EvaluEat
          which will be the first dish review app of its kind.</p>

      <section class="process">
          <h1 class="primary-headers">PROCESS</h1>
          <p> EvaluEat was developed to give our users the ability to always be
            satisfied with their restaurant order but allowing them to <span style="font-weight:600">see ratings
            & reviews for individual menu items.</span> This will allow our users to order
            the highest rated menu items and will give feedback to the restaurant
            on what they need to improve. We started with this idea and built
            EvaluEat using the following process.

        <h1 class="secondary-headers">1. DISCOVERY & RESEARCH</h1>
        <h2>User Survey</h2>
        <p>Before starting our design, we wanted to ensure that we were designing
          what our users both wanted and could use. To research this further, we
          created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfslEYVHO_bctryYu5nzFNfQ0J0OEIzhOm7HhjBoluyvIoxJQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">
          user survey</a> that asked <span style="font-weight:600">how much reviews affect our users’ decision making,
          what type of review has the most credibility, whether seeing reviews on a menu
          item would help them decide what to order, whether they would write a review themselves, etc.</span>

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>After we conducted our survey, we went on to perform
        a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYLXJPNH1puYhylz1pWHKjJ3rGhhgteORbzNE_L3EoM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">competitive analysis</a>
        for EvaluEat’s competitors looking for their strengths and flaws. We
        conducted a SWOT analysis of three different apps: Yelp, Bite, and Google.<br><br>

        Bite’s strengths were that they had <span style="font-weight:600">no major competitors, high app store
        ratings, and a unique idea.</span> However, their weaknesses were a <span style="font-weight:600">common brand
        name, being relatively unknown, and not having a large customer base to
        write reviews.</span> <br><br>Yelp’s strengths are that they are <span style="font-weight:600">widely known, they cover
        a lot of locations, and they have lots of photos and reviews.</span> Their
        weaknesses were that <span style="font-weight:600">you have to read through a whole restaurant review
        looking for a dish review, not a very user friendly interface, and only
        having reviews on the restaurant as a whole.</span><br><br> Google’s strengths here are the
        <span style="font-weight:600">massive user base, a very user friendly interface, and the ability to search
        within a particular area.</span> Their weaknesses for the purpose of this project
        are the <span style="font-weight:600">inability to rate dishes and the inability to search for a dish.</span>

        <h1 class="secondary-headers">3. VISUAL DESIGN<h1>
        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>After incorporating these changes, we proceeded to the visual design
          portion of our project. We started by coming up with a name. We knew we
          wanted to name the app something to do with food and reviews. You can see
          some of our brainstorming below.
<!-- Insert brainstorming images, mind maps, etc -->
          <br><br>After deciding on the name EvaluEat, we turned our focus to designing
          a logo. The logo had several iterations, but we decided on something simple with
          a touch of whimsey that could work well for both desktop and mobile. My original sketches and
          finished logo are below.
        </p>
      <div class="trunk-logos">
        <img src="images/evalueat-sketches.png" alt="original trunk sketches" class="sketches">

        <img src="images/evalueat-logo-bw.png" alt="black & white evalueat logo" class="bw-trunk-logo">
        <img src="images/evalueat-logo-bw2.png" alt="black & white evalueat logo" class="bw-trunk-logo2">
        <img src="images/white-evalueat-logo.png" alt="white evalueat logo" class="white-trunk-logos">
        <!-- <img src="images/grey-trunk-logo.png" alt="grey trunk logo" class="grey-trunk-logos"> -->
        <img src="images/black-evalueat-logo.png" alt="black evalueat logo" class="black-trunk-logos">
      </div>

      <p>Then, we moved on to create <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/R2zlyS318FM4qlKm0k4IvUXp/EvaluEat-Style-Guide?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">our style guide.</a>
        with a color scheme, typography, images, and more. Using this branding, we moved on to create our final mockups.

<!-- Change these images -->

        </div>
      </section>


      <section id="mockups">
        <h2>Mockups</h2>
        <p>With our style guide and logo in mind, we created mockups screens for both
          <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Dnuc7urUNFTs6QCWiAfBtSOr/EvaluEat-Mobile-Mockups?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">mobile</a>
          and <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/L4ebXJqD2wExwRHrcbeMqmLx/EvaluEat-Desktop-Mockups?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">desktop.</a>
          These screens were in full color and after many drafts and
          changes, we created both a <a href="https://invis.io/DCQ9YPOK6XH" target="_blank">mobile prototype</a> and
          <a hr="https://invis.io/V5QBTGXH6TP" target="_blank">desktop prototype</a> with Invision.</p>

        <section class="usability-tests-two">
          <h2>Usability Testing Round 2</h2>
          <p>When we were finished, we conducted another usability test
          to see how potential users would interact with our finished design.</p>
        </p>

        <h2 class="results">Findings:</h2>
        <table class="usability-table">
          <tr>
            <td class="usability-percent">50%</td>
            <td class="usability-stats">took an indirect route to find dish reviews</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="usability-percent">30%</td>
            <td class="usability-stats">wanted to write a review directly from the restaurant profile</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="usability-percent">10%</td>
            <td class="usability-stats">wanted darker search fields</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <h2 class="results">Improvements:</h2>
        <p>We took this feedback into account and incorporated several changes into our design.
          The most critical change was to utilize <span style="font-weight: bold;">two different options to find dish reviews-- </span>
          One via the restaurant profile page and on via the restaurant menu page. </p>


<!-- Change these to be EvaluEat improvements -->

        <img src="images/evalueat-usability-example-desktop.png" alt="organization process" class="evalueat-usability-desktop">


        <p>Another key change was to add the ability to <span style="font-weight:bold;">write a review from the restaurant profile. </span></p><br>

        <p>After many drafts and multiple tests, our <a href="https://invis.io/F6NZ726JUQE" target="_blank">final prototype</a> was ready.</p>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>During this project, I began to further <span style="font-weight: bold;">appreciate the necessity of Usability Tests. </span>
          For this project, I had more participants for my usability tests and was able to find
          issues that I likely wouldn’t have found if I had only tested a few people. <span style="font-weight: bold;">
          Having a larger tester base means that I get more opinions and diverse feedback which I can then incorporate
          into my design. </span>

          When we started, I was not sure about what features to have and whether there was a necessity
          for such an app. However, after completing the process, I am thrilled to say that I think
          EvaluEat will be a strong competitor in the market and will fill in the gap of restaurant
          reviewing that other apps have not yet filled.
