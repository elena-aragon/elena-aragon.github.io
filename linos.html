          <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
          <p>Take a look in your freezer right now. Go on, take a look. There's
            a very good chance that almost everything in your freezer right now
            was brought to you by Lineage. Lineage is the world's largest cold
            storage warehousing company with hundreds of warehouses that act as
            a middleman between food manufacturers and your grocery store with
            the accurate slogan: We help feed the world. In 2019, I joined the
            Lineage team to create one of four apps to optimize this process and
            make Lineage's warehouses run more smoothly. <br><br>

            While I started working on the Dock and Storage app with another
            designer, I was quickly assigned to take over the application as the
            sole designer and worked on building that application for over 18
            months. I worked with a team of brilliant designers, each working on
            one of the other apps for Lineage, to create a collection of apps
            known as LinOS. We worked very closely with the stakeholders to
            create <a href="#user-personas">User Personas,</a> create
            <a href="#user-flows">User Flows, create Wireframes,</a> write a
            <a href="#voice-documentation">Voice Script,</a> design <a href="#branding">
              Branding and Logos,</a> design <a href="#mockups">Mockups,</a> and
              present our work for bi-weekly review directly to the stakeholders.
              This was a tremendously complicated project as our work needed to
              accommodate different warehouses' processes, different devices,
              many workers who learned English as a second language, the problem
              of using a device in a frozen warehouse, incorporating the ability
              to go through the flows manually or with our voice assistant, the
              difficulty of using a touch screen with massive gloves, and so
              much more. Throughout the process, our team used everything from
              whiteboards to Figma, Miro, and LucidChart to bring our project
              to life.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Our task was to create a suite of apps that allowed Lineage’s
          warehouse employees to improve their workflow, avoid errors and
          lost product, and increase productivity. The app I created, Dock App,
          specifically focused on unloading pallets off of a truck and scanning
          and entering in product information for each pallet on the inbound
          process, then scanning pallets on the dock and loading them onto a
          truck on the outbound process. </p>
      </section>


      <section class="solution">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Our solution was to create a clean, highly efficient app called Dock
          App to improve our users’ workflow. We have gotten excellent feedback
          from our users that our app has sped up their process as well as
          prevented problems, like a misplaced pallet, from arising. The ability
          to go through a step by step flow on a device that is also capable of
          scanning barcodes and inputting information is both saving time and
          preventing human error.</p>

      <section class="process">
          <h1 class="primary-headers">PROCESS</h1>
          <p> On this project, I was able to work very closely with a Business
            Analyst who gathered requirements and wrote user stories to allow me
            to focus more closely on just the design process. They gathered
            requirements directly from the stakeholders which allowed me to
            build User Personas and very detailed User Flows as well as
            Wireframes. Finally, LinOS needed to have a voice assistant
            component, so we wrote a Voice Script outlining common phrases and
            rules for the talkback.

        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <p>After our team had visited the warehouse, conducted user interviews,
          and discovered our users’ painpoints, we were ready to create our
          <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/V2f2UAY62OXZCeWNV0jC1K/LinOS-Case-Study?node-id=2%3A16"

          <span style="font-weight:600">our supervisor as well as three employees
          with different experience levels</span>
          to make sure we were accommodating all of our users in our design plan.

        requirements from the stakeholders. While we created a User Flow for
        every flow in the app, each is very large and complex and so I’ve
        included just the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/V2f2UAY62OXZCeWNV0jC1K/LinOS-Case-Study?node-id=2%3A9"

              We went through several more iterations before
              moving on to our full color mockups. Again, the set of wireframes
              created were numerous, so in this case study I have simply
              presented the wireframes for what became the Unloading process.

          <section class="voice-documentation">
            <h2>Voice Documentation</h2>
            <p>A key aspect of LinOS would be the users’ ability to <span style="font-weight:600">
              utilize a voice assistant in addition to manually enter data</span>
              into the device. Because of the warehouse’s freezing temperature,
              <span style="font-weight:600">all employees wear large gloves that
                make it difficult to type or use a screen.</span>
                Therefore, it was key to have the ability to enter in all
                necessary information without ever touching the device.
                The stakeholders decided on wakewords and basic rules, but
                the design team worked together to write <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fqNf0eaNn_xjLwH_0pvX88nEz07eufcW/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
                Voice Documentation</a> making sure to
                prioritize the user’s experience. This document includes <span style="font-weight:600">a
                breakdown of talkback utterance anatomy, grammar, wakewords,
                and general rules for the talkback.</span> If the voice flow is
                not working, the user does also have the option to continue with
                the flow manually.

        <h2>Branding</h2>
      <p>Lineage came to us with existing colors and an existing company logo.
        However, they did not yet have a logo created for the suite of apps
        we were creating called LinOS. As a team, we worked together to create
        several options for the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/V2f2UAY62OXZCeWNV0jC1K/LinOS-Case-Study?node-id=11%3A232" target="_blank">

          many iterations due to new use cases, changing requirements, and
          feedback from users. They will continue to evolve as Levvel’s design
          team continues to work with Lineage to make the best possible
          experience for our users.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>During this project, I learned about how rewarding and challenging
          it can be to work directly with a client from the start of a project.
          I joined the LinOS team in the beginning of the project and there was
          so much discussion and so many iterations as we continued to learn new
          information. Lineage is the world's largest cold storage company, and
          I have never worked on a project that was so large and complex before.
          However, after working with Lineage for 18 months, I can confidently
           say that I am ready to handle any project in the future.
